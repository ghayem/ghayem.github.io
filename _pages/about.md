Starting March 2023, I am serving as a postdoctoral researcher at the [MIND team](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) in [Inria-Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr) working under the supervision of [Prof. Bertrand Thirion](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=MeKi5_AAAAAJ&hl=fr). My current research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and statistics to analyze brain metadata using Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of neuroscience and neuroimaging.

Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher for a year at the [MLSP-lab](https://mlsp.umbc.edu/) in the [University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)](https://umbc.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Tulay Adali](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KgjUnawAAAAJ&hl=en). During this period, my research was focused on studying the brain for identifying new patterns and discriminant features of brain functional network connectivity, subgroup identification, brain graph neural network, and reproducibility and replicability assessment. I obtained my Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from the [GIPSA-lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/), [University Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), under supervision of [Prof. Christian Jutten](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iO3qCToAAAAJ) and [Dr. Bertrand Rivet](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~bertrand.rivet/index.html), where I worked on optimal sensor placement for source extraction. I also have an M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology), where I explored the reconstruction of magnetic resonance images using compressed sensing techniques. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked as a research assistant at the DSP-lab in Sharif University of Technology under supervision of [Prof. Massoud Babaie-Zadeh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5H-SuMcAAAAJ&hl=en) where I developed accelerated dictionary learning algorithms for minimizing a non-smooth and non-convex sparsity-promoting function and developed an efficient solver for this problem by using a penalty method along with proximal ideas.

I am nemophilist, and aesthete!<br/>
I have a keen interest in playing the violin, and running!

## Research Interests 
* Large Language Model (LLM) for brain meta-analysis
* Statistical signal processing and Bayesian modeling
* Machine Learning
* Numerical Optimization
* Dictionary Learning
* Optimal sensor placement for source extraction
* Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Independent Vector Analysis (IVA) for multiset fMRI data
* Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

<!-- ## A bit more about me:
- I am more of a qualitative researcher than a quantitative one and I believe that the formation of a united team that cares about the quality of research can eventually cover the quantitative part.
- I am nemophilist, and aesthete!<br/>
- I have a keen interest in playing the violin!
- I MeditaRun (a particular type of running I have designed suitable for me adapted to my body responses that is combined with meditation). As far as I know, I am the first person to use the word 'MeditaRun', and I consider the copyright to belong to me. The more I get to know myself, the more I am able to refine my individual running techniques and better understand how to harmonize my mind and body through MeditaRun.

<!-- ## My hierarchical opinion about research
- Research should be a piece of art! Quality matters, and it should be respected.
- Productivity is also important. That's where team working takes place.
- Team working requires strong communication skills. That's why ethics is important.
- Ethics directly relates to mental health.<br/>
- **Conclusion:** The prerequisite for a researcher is to have a good mental health. This needs constant special care! -->
