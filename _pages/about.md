I am a researcher with the [Multispeech team](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at Inria Nancy - Grand Est, France. My current research focuses on robust audio-visual speech processing.

From August 2018 to October 2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher with the [Perception team](https://team.inria.fr/perception/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (now, [RobotLearn team](https://team.inria.fr/robotlearn/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) at Inria Grenoble Rh√¥ne-Alpes, France, working with [Radu Horaud](https://team.inria.fr/perception/team-members/radu-patrice-horaud/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Xavier Alameda-Pineda](http://xavirema.eu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

Research Interests
======
* Latent variable generative models, e.g., variational autoencoders (VAEs)
* Unsupervised audio-visual speech enhancement using generative models
* Bayesian inference and probabilistic machine learning
* Local/global optimization
* Sparse representation, compressed sensing, dictionary learning
