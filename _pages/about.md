I am a researcher, nemophilist, and aesthete!<br/>
I have a keen interest in playing the violin!<br/>
I wish I could dance ballet! One day, I might! For now, I run instead.<br/>
Personality: emotional, sensitive, logical, moderately extraverted, strict, relatively stubborn, altruistic, and social.

## Research Interests 
* Statistical signal processing 
* Machine learning
* Local/global optimization
* Dictionary learning, sparse representation, compressed sensing
* Optimal sensor placement for source extraction
* Independent component analysis (ICA) and independent vector analysis (IVA) for multiset data
* Graph signal processing (GSP) and graph neural net (GNN)

My opinions about research: 
- Research should be a piece of art! Quality matters, and it should be respected.
- Productivity is also important. That's where team working takes place.
- Team working requires strong communication skills. That's why ethics is important.
- Ethics directly relates to mental health.
- Conclusion: The prerequisite of a researcher is to have good mental health, which needs attention.
