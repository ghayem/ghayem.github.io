I am a researcher in the [MULTISPEECH team](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/) at Inria Nancy - Grand Est, France. My current research focuses on robust audio-visual speech processing.

From August 2018 to October 2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [PERCEPTION team](https://team.inria.fr/perception/) (now, [RobotLearn team](https://team.inria.fr/robotlearn/)) at Inria Grenoble Rh√¥ne-Alpes, France, working with [Radu Horaud](https://team.inria.fr/perception/team-members/radu-patrice-horaud/) and [Xavier Alameda-Pineda](http://xavirema.eu/). 

Research Interests
======
* Latent variable generative models: variational autoencoders (VAEs)
* Unsupervised audio-visual speech enhancement using generative models
* Bayesian inference and probabilistic machine learning
* Local/global optimization
* Sparse representation, compressed sensing, dictionary learning
