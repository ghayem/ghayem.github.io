Starting March 2023, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [MIND team](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) in [Inria-Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr) supervised by [Bertrand Thirion](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=MeKi5_AAAAAJ&hl=fr). My current research is on the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and statistics for brain meta-analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher for a year at the [MLSP-lab](https://mlsp.umbc.edu/) in the [University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)](https://umbc.edu/) supervised by [Tulay Adali](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KgjUnawAAAAJ&hl=en). During this period, my research was on studying the brain for identifying new patterns and discriminant features of brain functional network connectivity, subgroup identification, brain graph neural network, and reproducibility and replicability assessment. I obtained my Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from the [GIPSA-lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/), [University Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), under supervision of [Christian Jutten](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iO3qCToAAAAJ) and [Bertrand Rivet](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~bertrand.rivet/index.html), where I worked on optimal sensor placement for source extraction. I also have an M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology), where I explored the reconstruction of magnetic resonance images using compressed sensing techniques. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked as a research assistant at the DSP-lab in Sharif University of Technology supervised by [Massoud Babaie-Zadeh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5H-SuMcAAAAJ&hl=en) where I developed accelerated dictionary learning algorithms for minimizing a non-smooth and non-convex sparsity-promoting function and developed an efficient solver for this problem by using a penalty method along with proximal ideas.

I am nemophilist, and aesthete!<br/>
I have a keen interest in playing the violin, and running!
