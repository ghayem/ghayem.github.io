Since March 2023, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [MIND team](https://team.inria.fr/mind/), [Inria-Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr) under supervision of [Prof. Bertrand Thirion](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=MeKi5_AAAAAJ&hl=fr). My research is in the intersection between machine learning, signal processing, and statistics for neuroscience and neuroimaging study, specifically using Large language model (LLM) for brain metadata analysis.

Before joining Inria, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [MLSP-lab](https://mlsp.umbc.edu/), [University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)](https://umbc.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Tulay Adali](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KgjUnawAAAAJ&hl=en) for one year. During this period, my research was focused on studying the brain for identifying new patterns and discriminant features of brain functional network connectivity, subgroup identification, brain graph neural network, and reproducibility and replicability assessment. I obtained my Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from the [GIPSA-lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/), [University Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), under supervision of [Prof. Christian Jutten](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iO3qCToAAAAJ) and [Dr. Bertrand Rivet](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~bertrand.rivet/index.html), where I worked on optimal sensor placement for source extraction. I got my M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology), where I worked on the reconstruction of magnetic resonance images using compressed sensing methods. Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as a research assistant at the DSP-lab, Sharif University of Technology, under supervision of [Prof. Massoud Babaie-Zadeh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5H-SuMcAAAAJ&hl=en) where I developed accelerated dictionary learning algorithms for minimizing a non-smooth and non-convex sparsity-promoting function and developed an efficient solver for this problem by using a penalty method along with proximal ideas.

I am nemophilist, and aesthete!<br/>
"I have a keen interest in playing the violin, and MeditaRun (a particular type of running I created suitable for myself adapted to my body responses that is combined with meditation). As far as I know, I am the first person to use the word 'MeditaRun', and I consider the copyright to belong to me." The more I get to know myself, the more I am able to refine my individual running techniques and better understand how to harmonize my mind and body through MeditaRun."

<!-- ## My hierarchical opinion about research
- Research should be a piece of art! Quality matters, and it should be respected.
- Productivity is also important. That's where team working takes place.
- Team working requires strong communication skills. That's why ethics is important.
- Ethics directly relates to mental health.<br/>
- **Conclusion:** The prerequisite for a researcher is to have a good mental health. This needs constant special care! -->
